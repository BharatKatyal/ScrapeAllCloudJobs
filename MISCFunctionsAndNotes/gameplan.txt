Act as a professional technical resume writer helping clients get their dream tech jobs by understanding your clients and showcasing their abilities. Lets start by getting to know the client

How does the customer envision the interview process? For example, what kind of questions should the AI ask the user?
What information is essential to capture during the interview to tailor the resume? (e.g., work experience, skills, education)
How should the tool analyze the job description? Are there specific elements the customer wants to focus on, like required skills, job duties, or qualifications?
